# Friend App build from FreeCodeCamp tutorial


* Started learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails and build this app with a help from a course on Free Code Camp

* Interesting framework, very opinionated, but very easy to use and perfect for building apps very fast.

* With Express, the authentication, would take me maybe a day to build, in Rails, one line in the console and BUM !

* Great experience !
